# Cognigy REST Challenge

## Data Model

The Car data model is based on [https://schema.org/Car](https://schema.org/Car). A `Car` has an internal identifier (`id`) which is a UUID URN automatically generated by the API implementation. In addition each `Car` resource has a unique `vehicleIdentificationNumber` that also plays the role of ObjectId in Mongo, so that its uniqueness is preserved. The `vehicleIdentificationNumber` must be supplied, together with `brand` and `model` when creating a new `Car` resource. When updating an existing `Car` resource the `vehicleIdentificationNumber` **must not** be present. `Car` resources are represented using [JSON-LD](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data), thus the `@context` member is present. 

## How to run

### Prerequisites

* docker & docker-compose
* Node 16
* npm 8

### Steps

There is an intermediate step to create the Docker network on which the containers will live. 

```sh
npm install
npm run docker-network
npm run start-docker
```

### Testing

Afterwards the API service will be listening to `http://localhost:5000` and also a MongoDB container will be running. You can test the service is running properly by

```sh
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:5000/cars'
```

### API Definition

* Postman collection
* Open API Specification

### Additional tasks

* It would be good to automatically generate the mongoose Schema from the JSON Schema to avoid repetition and improve maintainability
* It would be good to incorporate functional tests to test all the API functionality in a CI basis
